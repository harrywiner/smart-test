> I have a working hello world working on Firebase, after a lot of workarounds and headscratching, this really do be a piece of shit imo

###Â Todo

- make the smarthome recieve data from my server, possibly recieving a message from server and putting it into the text to speach

* figure out how to hit my website from google assistant
* figure out how to respond with json
* figure out how to process that json and act accoringly

Im pretty sure all of that is what fulfillment is
